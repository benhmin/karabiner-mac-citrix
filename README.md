This is a repo to hold several complex modifications for karabiner for Mac

Specifically, they are for controlling F2 and Alt behavior in Citrix for use with Epic Hyperspace Electronic Health Record

## Installation

There are two main folders:
- Regular Keyboard
- Touchbar Mac

The complex modifications need to be placed in the following folder (after installation of Karabiner Elements for Mac)
- ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/
