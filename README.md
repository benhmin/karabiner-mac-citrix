This is a repo to hold several complex modifications for karabiner for Mac

Specifically, they are for controlling F2 and Alt behavior in Citrix for use with Epic Hyperspace Electronic Health Record


There are two main folders:
- Regular Keyboard
- Touchbar Mac


The complex modifications need to be placed in the following folder (after installation of Karabiner Elements for Mac)
- ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/


See the [word document](https://github.com/benhmin/karabiner-mac-citrix/blob/main/Epic%20F2%20Mac%20Guide.docx?raw=true) in this repo for additional instructions.
